abstract = "#### Objective  The present study reports on the long‐term effects of a mindfulness‐based stress reduction (MBSR) program for adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse.  ### Method  Of the study participants, 73% returned to the clinic for a single‐session follow‐up assessment of depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and mindfulness at 2.5 years. ### Results    Repeated measures mixed regression analyses revealed significant long‐term improvements in depression, PTSD, anxiety symptoms, and mindfulness scores. The magnitude of intervention effects at 128 weeks ranged from d = .5 to d = 1.1. ### Conclusion    MBSR may be an effective long‐term treatment for adults who have experienced childhood sexual abuse. Further investigation of MBSR with this population is warranted given the durability of treatment effects described here."
