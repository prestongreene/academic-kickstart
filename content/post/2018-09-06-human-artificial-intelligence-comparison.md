I had an interesting conversation at a meetup not long ago comparing human intelligence and AI, and recently came across [this article](https://thenextweb.com/syndication/2018/09/01/human-intelligence-and-ai-are-vastly-different-so-lets-stop-comparing-them/) about the differences between them. The thesis of the article is that human intelligence and AI are totally different things, and although they function similarly at times, it is wrong to compare them. The article correctly identifies where AI excels - detecting subtle patterns in massive amounts of data that would easily overwhelm humans, but also where AI falls short, namely in abstract thinking and true learning.

I don't think it is wrong to compare human intelligence and AI per se, but I think it is important to compare them correctly. Namely, when comparing human intelligence and AI, it is important to recognize the developmental nature of human intelligence, and to view AI in a similar developmental context. 

If you have ever raised or followed a child as they grow, you know that children's cognitive abilities develop in a nonlinear, stage-based 


(whereupon, after detecting a problem to solve, the solution is then retained and applied to other problems of similar nature)

Ever since I read [This blog post by David Robinson](http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/) I've been kicking around the idea of writing a blog, but until now never put in the effort to get one up and running. So what changed? Why now? I can identify a few factors that helped me reach this point: 

1. I started attending some data-focused meetups. So far my favorite has been the [Data Viz and Snacks meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Data-Viz-Jam-Sessions/), where I've met some cool people (and eaten some tasty snacks). Attending meetups has helped me to realize that there are a lot of things that seem to pass for being a data scientist, and that I have a lot of those same skills. My mind recalled David Robinson's blog post when a woman at a meetup mentioned that writing a blog is also a great way to connect with other like-minded data aficionados, which I most certainly want to do.

2. I see blogging as a way to practice writing about data in a more natural, intuitive way. I value being engaged in the public discourse about data science (and other topics), and I wasn't pursuing that value. A main impetus for me to teach myself how to program statistical analyses in R was a desire to create more reproducible research. As I learned more about doing academic research in a more reproducible way, I began to realize that valuable writing can come in many forms, not just journal articles. There are a number of critiques I could direct at the academic publishing industry (a future topic for sure), but one of the biggest drawbacks of the academic model that incentivizes peer-reviewed journal articles above all others is that so many other great ways to communicate ideas and research are given less attention and regard. Peer-reviewed journals are just one avenue (with a fairly limited audience) via which to communicate. Textbooks and lecture notes have been some of my favorite ways to learn, especially when they are written in a conversational tone. I find discussing many different data-related topics intellectually stimulating, albeit lacking in my academic professional life, and blogging represents a way for me to engage with others and satisfy some of that desire. 

3. Teaching others about things I know and am passionate about (i.e. using data and statistics) is another area of my professional self that is not fulfilled in my current professional role. Recently, it occurred to me that I don't need to have a classroom of students to teach, and this blog can also provide some of that didactic fulfillment. So some of what I will write about will strike a tutorial/educational tone.

### So here we are. First post down, with many more to come. 

I hope you'll enjoy reading as much as I hope I'll enjoy writing. Feel free to comment or reach out!
